## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Typing keeps the previous suggestion list until the next answer
The system SHALL keep the currently displayed suggestion list while the user types in the German word input, replacing it only when the dictionary delivers the answer for the new prefix. A keystroke SHALL NOT blank the list.

#### Scenario: A further keystroke does not blank the list
- **WHEN** a suggestion list is visible
- **AND** the user types another character
- **THEN** the previous list stays visible through the debounce and lookup
- **AND** the dictionary's answer for the new prefix replaces it

#### Scenario: Emptying the input clears the list
- **WHEN** a suggestion list is visible
- **AND** the user empties the input
- **THEN** the list is cleared once the dictionary answers with no completions for the empty prefix

#### Scenario: Picking from a kept list uses the entry's own data
- **WHEN** the visible list still belongs to a previous prefix
- **AND** the user picks an entry (click, Enter, or Tab)
- **THEN** the word and translation are filled from that entry's own lemma and translations
- **AND** the list is cleared

#### Scenario: Submit still clears the list
- **WHEN** the add-word form submits successfully
- **THEN** the form reset clears the suggestion list along with the inputs
